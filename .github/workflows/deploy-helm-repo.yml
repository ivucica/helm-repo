  # Runs every day at midnight UTC, similar to the TrueCharts daily task.
  #Disabled intentionally until it can be optimized. 788+ charts take way too long to generate, only
  #those that are different should be updated. Fetching the current index.yaml may be a way out of
  #it, running locally, running concurrently (see .github/scripts/cr.sh), or maybe even fetching
  #the built version from oci://quay.io/truecharts and just indexing it could do the trick.
